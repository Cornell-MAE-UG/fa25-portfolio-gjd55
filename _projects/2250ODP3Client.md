# Save the Grapes!!


**Team:** Save the Grapes
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E\&J Gallo Winery / National Grape  


**Problem Statement**: Spotted lanternflies (SLFs) land on grape vines and feed on plant sugars, contaminating grape harvests, reducing yields, and causing worse-tasting grapes for consumers. SFLs also release sticky mold, which covers leaves, inhibiting photosynthesis and harming vine growth. These effects can cost the $16.81 billion wine industry millions of dollars in lost yields. Due to the high volume of SLF and strict safety regulations, vines could be damaged by sufficiently thorough on-plant removal methods. How can we remove the lantern flies from the grape vines without harming the plant and is there a way to attract them away from the vines themselves?
 
## Impact
Grape farmers can face significant losses if their harvests are damaged or destroyed. When SLFs land on grape vines and suck their sap, plant growth is hindered, and grapes become sour. Grapes grown in regions no longer affected by spotted lantern flies would taste sweeter, farmers and consumers would not have to fear their products being contaminated by SLFs, and the price of grape products would remain stable due to increased production volume.



## Proposed direction(s)


### Concept A (primary): LanterVine

   What is it:
   
   - A faux grape vine made from sustainable materials that mimics the qualities and smells of attractants for lantern flies. This idea serves to draw lantern flies away from real grape vines, allowing them to be captured and disposed of. 

How would it be used: 
      
   - Multiple vines would be set up throughout the vineyard at the discretion of the owner
   - These fake vines would contain faux Tree of Heaven sap, which SLFs prefer to the grapes, as well as a 60Hz emitter, which SLFs are attracted to  

Why is it better than the status quo?:

   - Farms currently spray pesticides to deter SLFs, which fade after only a few days
   - No interference with existing growing processes. The traps do not touch the grape vines.

Prototype: 

- One single vine made from 3D prints, wood, and purchased parts, complete with a speaker that emits 60 hz vibrations, and containing liquid to simulate Tree of Heaven sap.
The prototype will be a smaller proof-of-concept than the final product for vineyards due to the accelerated timeline of MAE 2250.

## Key risks / unknowns


**Risk 1**: Faux grape vine traps may occupy usable growing space in vineyards. We will test how the product's size changes its effectiveness by altering variables such as trap size, sap potency, and vibration frequency.

**Risk 2**: The vine may attract unwanted insects or animals to the vineyards, so we will monitor the trap at the site before full implementation.


## Questions for the client


1. **How much space does the client have available for the traps on the farm?**  
   *This will help us determine the size of our traps based on given constraints.* 

2. **What are the dimensions of an average vineyard/ (rows, terrain, trellises, etc.)?**  
   *This will help us determine the best way to integrate our trap with each farm.*

3. **Are there any environmental regulations you think we should be aware of?**  
   *This will help us decide if we need to alter our design to follow regulations.* 


4. **How much labor can the client divert towards maintaining the grape vine traps every season?**
   *This will allow us to determine the level of maintenance our traps can have.*
