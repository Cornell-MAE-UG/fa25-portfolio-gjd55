  The Raptor 2 rocket engine is a rocket engine used by SpaceX that was designed
  for full-flow staged combustion. It has a bell-shaped nozzle made of a copper
  alloy for heat resistance. Its slightly wider throat relative to Raptor 1
  improved thrust output while making minor efficiency tradeoffs.
