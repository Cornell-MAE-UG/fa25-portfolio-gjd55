description: Thermodynamics of Raptor 2 Rocket Nozzle description: The Raptor 2 rocket engine is a rocket engine used by SpaceX that was desgined for full flow staged combustion. It has a bell shaped nozzle made of copper alloy for hear resistance. Its slightly wider throat relative to the Raptor 1 improved thrust output while making minor efficiency tradeoffs.
